					<h1>GRIDS</h1>

					<p>Many things are displayed using Grids. To keep
						things simple, a grid is always a row of "boxes". 
						If there appears to be 6 same-sized boxes, 3 on
						top of the other, it is actually two
						different "div.grid_3" classes, holding
						three different "div.box" containers, stacked.
					</p>
					
					<h2>"Featured" Grid</h2>
					
					<p>This is 3 colored boxes, with a icon,
						that looks like this:
					</p>	
					
					<div class="grid_3 featured">
						<div class="box grey">
							<h3 class="r">COMMUNICATION</h4>
								I am a native English
								speaker with super-strong spoken
								and written comm skills
							<span class="material-icons" style="color: #666;">&#xebba;</span>
						</div>
						<div class="box pink">
							<h3 class="r">RESOURCEFULLNESS</h4>
							<span class="material-icons" style="color: #ff93ac;">&#xea24;</span>
								<span style="relative;">With internet access
								and a couple hours, I can
								teach myself anything on
								almost anything</span>
						</div>
						<div class="box blue">
							<h3 class="r">KNOWLEDGE</h4>
								I have a breadth of knowledge
								that has touched on most
								internet tech over a long
								career
								<span class="material-icons" style="color: #53a7d8;">&#xea19;</span>
						</div><!-- end: box -->		
					</div><!-- end this grid row -->			

					<p class="note">NOTE 1: The colors of the boxes
						are from "default.css," but the icon
						colors are inline styles (and use 
						<a href="https://fonts.google.com/icons" target="_blank">Google Font
						Icons</a>).</p>

					<p class="note">NOTE 2: Other			
						types of grids will come in the future.
