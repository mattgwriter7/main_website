					<h1>FONTS</h1>

					<p>I am keeping it simple!</p>	
					
					<h2>Headings</h2>
					
					<p>There are only 3 headings: H1, H2, and H3s. An 
						H1 is where it says "FONTS," and H2 is where it
						says "Headings," and here is an H3:
					<p>

					<h3>This Is An H3 Example</h3>

					<p>As you can see the H3 does not do <i>that</i> much.  
						Pretty well it is just bolded and serif-ed.
					</p>

					<p>But the H1 and H2s are kinda fancy.  They have 
						some CSS-stylin' to make them POP!</p>	
					
					<p>
						There is never top margins or paddings on
						Heading tags by default.  But!  They will have
						bottom-margins.  To get rid of a bottom-margin
						use a class="short" which will strip it
						completely.<br />
						<span class="note">NOTE:
							The amount of bottom-margin is different for 
							H1, H2, and H3.  
						</span>
					</p>
					
					<h3>Styling Fonts</h3>

					<p>You can bold, italicize, and underline stuff
						using normal HTML. (That is: &lt;i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;,
						and &lt;u&gt;.)
					</p>
					
					<p>But there are also some shortcuts for 
					"special effects," like this:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>&lt;b class="o"&gt; = <b class="o">Oswald</b></li>
						<li>&lt;b class="r"&gt; = <b class="r">Roboto</b></li>
						<li>&lt;b class="m"&gt; = <b class="m">Monospaced</b></li>
					</ul>			

					<p class="note">NOTE: A &lt;b&gt; on its own will bold, but
						when you add one of the shortcut classes above, it is not
						bolded. (Go figure!)
					</p>
					
					<h3>Notes and Other Effects</h3>
					<p>You can do a "hint" or "note" with class="note", 
						like this:</p>
					
					<p class="note">NOTE: This "note" text is done using...
							class="note" on a &lt;p&gt; tag! (Go figure!)
					</p>	
					
					<p class="dropcap">
						This is a "dropcap," which I made adding 
						class="dropcap" to the paragraph tag.  However,
						this should only be used when there is "deep"
						text. If the text is only one line you will
						get the dreaded dangling dropcap... you have
						been warned!
					</p>
