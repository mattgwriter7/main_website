# ~ main_website ~
This is the repo for my main website:   
* [www.mattgwriter7.com](https://mattgwriter7.com/?k=d)

## DETAILS
There are actually 3 versions of my site:  
* [developer](https://mattgwriter7.com/?k=d)   
* [gamebook demo](https://mattgwriter7.com/?k=b)   
* [writer](https://mattgwriter7.com/?k=w)    

I use one codebase for all three, and just have different sections show up according to what I prioritize.  

Literally the code all three sites is right here.  

## NOTES
See [NOTES](https://github.com/mattgwriter7/main_website/blob/main/NOTES.md)  for more detailed notes, including where I am at with this project, and future plans.
