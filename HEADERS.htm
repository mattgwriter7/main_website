This panel is in rough form still...
(these are notes in a "pre" tag)

HEADERS:
Very simple
* 2 views: desktop and mobile,
		with different heights
* contains a custom H1 tag
	
HERO
Very simple
* 2 views: desktop and mobile,
	with different heights
		
FOOTER
Not so simple.		
* 2 views: desktop and mobile
* uses CSS image sprite (so the
	social icons are really a single
	image)
