					<h1>STICKIES</h1>

					<p>These are litte orange-yellow notes that 
						are meant to draw attention to something.  
						They can be clicked to dismiss.

					<h3>Positioning</h3>

					<p>Stickies are usually positioned on top of stuff
						using absolute positioning, and they have a 
						little shadow effect to make them look
						raised up.
					</p>
					
					<p>You position them with a positioning class,
						like this:</p>
					
					<p>
						<b class="m">class="bottom_right"</b>, or<br />
						<b class="m">class="top_right"</b>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						If no posisioning class is provided they will
						behave wonky. (Because they are absolutely
						positioned, they are liable to overlap
						content underneath in an undesirable way.)
					</p>
					<!-- <p>Stickies require:<br />
						<b class="m">data-bottom-right="10x10"</b><br />
						where the "10x10", or whatever numbers
						are used, are the x and y co-ordinates 
						to use to position the sticky.
					</p>	
					
				
					
					<p>Right now there is only "data-bottom-right," but
						there will probably be 3 others in the future.  Basically
						elements that have this attribute count on
						being hidden until the page is loaded and
						the co-ordinates are fetched.  At <i>that</i>
						point the snippet is faded in.
					</p>

					<div class="sticky bottom_right">This 
						is a "sticky," used to
						draw attention to something.  It can be dismissed
						with a simple click.<br />
						<span class="note">Note how it overlaps the 
							content underneath. That is by design, dude.
							It ain't meant to be part of the regular flow
							of the page. (Sheesh!)</span>
