# NOTES 
This is a place for stuff that doesn't fit under [README](https://github.com/mattgwriter7/main_site/blob/main/README.md) 

## GOALS
I wanted to make a professional portfolio, but I wear different hats so needed it to showcase different "hats." (Developer, and writer, specifically.)   

The code for my main_website is based on 
[html_components](https://github.com/mattgwriter7/html_components) (very clean HTML/CSS/Javascript "components" I can just plop into projects.) 

## DETAILED DETAILS

### NAMING CONVENTIONS
* variables are "lowercase_with_hyphens"
* methods are "camelCased()"...
* programming classes are capitalized, and always have the filename exactly matching the class name (so the "Config" class is "Config.dart", for instance)
  + But, CSS classes will be "lowercase_with_hyphens" (like variables, above)
* REALLY_IMPORTANT variables can be all caps and underscored
   + but there should only be 1 or 2 "really important" variables in an app
   + in this App there are: STORY_KEY, and PASSAGE_KEY (both in Config.dart)
