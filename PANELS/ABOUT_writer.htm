					<ol id="things_list" class="touchup1">
						<li>I am passionate about <i>the written word</i>! Some
							would even call me a &ldquo;logophile&rdquo; (<i>Look it 
							up, amateur!</i>)</li>
						<li>I have a highly rated App on 
							<b class="r">Google&nbsp;Play</b> that I created using 
							<b class="r">Flutter</b>&#153;</li>
						<li>In high school my nickname was 
							&ldquo;Matty&nbsp;Bob&rdquo; because I
							lived in Kentucky before moving to
							Toronto</li>
						<li>My wife begged me to reconsider using that goofy picture. (&ldquo;Who would hire that dweeb?&rdquo; she asked.)</li>
						<li>I dislike almonds and walnuts, but love cashews and pistachios (though they are seldom part of 
						my <i>love-making</i>, to be clear)</li>

					<h2>Top 3 Skills</h2>	
						<p>These are the skills that separate me
							from other Writer-dudes:</p>
							
					<div class="grid_3 featured">
						<div class="box grey">
							<h3 class="r">VERSATILITY</h4>
								I am comfortable,
								and skilled!, in all-manner of
								writing styles and literary genres.
							<span class="material-icons" style="color: #666;">&#xe746;</span>
						</div>
						<div class="box pink">
							<h3 class="r">RESOURCEFULLNESS</h4>
							<span class="material-icons" style="color: #ff93ac;">&#xe80c;</span>
								<span style="relative;">With internet access
								and a couple hours, I can
								teach myself anything on
								almost anything</span>
						</div>
						<div class="box blue">
							<h3 class="r">CREATIVITY</h4>
								I am quirky, but creative.  I love
								<i>making stuff</i> and put
								a unique spin on eveything I do!
