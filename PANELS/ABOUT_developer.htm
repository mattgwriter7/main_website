					<h2>My Code is C-L-E-A-N!</h2>
					<p>Guess what? I am not the smartest or best coder 
					 out there.  But, I do take pride in my clean,
					 easy-to-understand code.  
					 I try to write stuff that other people can
					 easily understand, as well as myself, when I
					 re-visit stuff later.
