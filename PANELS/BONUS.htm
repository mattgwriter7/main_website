					<h1>Bonus Section</h1>
					
					<p class="dropcap">Have you ever heard of a "gamebook"?  It
						is a choose-your-own-adventure 
						thingamajig which is
						half book and half game.  They were very popular
						back in the 1980s for a bit, when Dungeons
						& Dragons was all the rage.
					</p>		
					
					

					<p><i class="small">May I present</i>...</p>
					
					<h3 class="tall">"The Dark Castle of Murwyche"</h3>
					<p>
						You can play it  right here by
						clicking the blue "begin" button. It actually works!
					</p>	
					
					<p>
						My goal is to have this be a Mobile App that serves as
						a wrapper for an unlimited number of stories.  Ideally
						a community would develop that can write these stories,
						but for now there is just... me.  
					</p>

					<p>The "gamebook" concept combines
						my two main interests: 
						<b class="r">Writing</b> and 
						<b class="r">Coding</b>.					
					</p>	
					
					<p>I am still fleshing out "The Dark Castle...", but
						I have done the first several passages.  I
						hope you try it out and come to
						enjoy it. I welcome feeback 
						on the story as well as the app.<br /> 
						<span class="note"><b>Note</b>: Keep in mind they are both
						<i>very much</i> "works in progress."</span>
